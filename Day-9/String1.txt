String - Immutable,StringBuffer,StringBuilder
when string object needs to be modified very often we should not use string object.

StringBuffer - java.lang- Mutable class - synchronized class
we cannot make the string literal as mutable by using the StringBuffer.
StringBuffer sb = "abc";

Synchronized 
A thread - safe , mutable sequence of characters.

Non- Synchronized

StringBuilder - non synchronized class - java.lang - Mutable Class - JDK 1.5

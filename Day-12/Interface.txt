nested types.

Class: Template

#Interface:
* By default methods in the interface are abstract
* By default all methods in the interface are public
* Do not reduce visibility of the methods
* private access modifier is not allowed in interface
* variable(fields or global variable) in the interface are by default final and static


global variable/fields/variable--> private, protected modifier not allowed

        Interface:                                                abstract

All methods are abstract till java 8                      one method can be abstract 
all variables are final and static                        no,not compulsary 
uses implements keyword                                   uses extends keyword 
constructor is not possible                               constructor is possible

interface is 100 percent abstrat class or not ? NO 
can we creatr constructor for class ? NO
